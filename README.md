This is dwm with a number of improvements, many of which have been contributed
upstream. There are a non-trivial amount of changes/refactors to core dwm code,
but I do keep the changes in sync with upstream (see the
[`sync`](https://github.com/cdown/dwm/blob/master/sync) script).

A lot of the code is unused (eg. I don't use the bar, window titles, etc.) but
in order to minimise merge conflicts, the dead code is left alone, and we just
rely on compiler code elimination to do dead code removal.
