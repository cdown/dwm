This is my personal fork of dwm. There are a non-trivial amount of
changes/refactors to core dwm code, but I do keep the changes in sync with
upstream (see the [`sync`](https://github.com/cdown/dwm/blob/master/sync)
script).

A lot of the code is unused (eg. I don't use the bar, window titles, etc.) but
in order to minimise merge conflicts, the dead code is left alone.

# Patches

## Written by me

- alwaysfullscreen (upstreamed)
- killunsel (upstreamed)

It looks something like this when used along with [my
dotfiles](https://github.com/cdown/dotfiles) and [ansible
playbook](https://github.com/cdown/ansible-desktop):
