This is my personal fork of dwm. There are a non-trivial amount of
changes/refactors to core dwm code, but I do keep the changes in sync with
upstream (see the [`sync`](https://github.com/cdown/dwm/blob/master/sync)
script).

It looks something like this when used along with [my
dotfiles](https://github.com/cdown/dotfiles) and [ansible
playbook](https://github.com/cdown/ansible-desktop):

I use a bunch of my own patches here, which are listed
[here](http://suckless.org/people/cdown). For the whole list, look at the
commit history, it should clear what comes from where.
